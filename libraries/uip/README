This is UIPEthernet version 1.0, a wrapper library around uIP, which provides the 
Arduino with TCP/IP connectivity for the enc28j60 ethernet chip.

This library is written by Norbert Truchsess <norbert.truchsess@t-online.de>

The wrapper library is based on the SerialIP implementation by Adam Nielsen <malvineous@shikadi.net>

uIP was written by Adam Dunkels of the Networked Embedded Systems group at the 
Swedish Institute of Computer Science.
