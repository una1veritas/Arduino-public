PROGMEM prog_char text[] = "Book I, 84:\n	If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd\nFrom him, who in the happy Realms of Light \nCloth'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine\nMyriads though bright: If he Whom mutual league,\nUnited thoughts and counsels, equal hope\nAnd hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,\nJoynd with me once, now misery hath joynd \nIn equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest\nFrom what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd\nHe with his Thunder: and till then who knew\nThe force of those dire Arms? yet not for those,\nNor what the Potent Victor in his rage \nCan else inflict, do I repent or change,\nThough chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind\nAnd high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,\nThat with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,\nAnd to the fierce contention brought along \nInnumerable force of Spirits arm'd\nThat durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,\nHis utmost power with adverse power oppos'd\nIn dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,\nAnd shook his throne. What though the field be lost? \nAll is not lost; the unconquerable Will,\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate,\nAnd courage never to submit or yield:\nAnd what is else not to be overcome?\nThat Glory never shall his wrath or might \nExtort from me. To bow and sue for grace\nWith suppliant knee, and deifie his power,\nWho from the terrour of this Arm so late\nDoubted his Empire, that were low indeed,\nThat were an ignominy and shame beneath \nThis downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods\nAnd this Empyreal substance cannot fail,\nSince through experience of this great event\nIn Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,\nWe may with more successful hope resolve \nTo wage by force or guile eternal Warr\nIrreconcileable, to our grand Foe,\nWho now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy\nSole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.\n";
