That said I need to clarify that this assembler version is a modified
version, because both MCUs are different. atmega328p has less pins, and
it is slower than Dmitry's project, because Arduino has just a 16Mhz clock.
Also, the Dmitry version does not work with atmega328 without several changes.

In order to have a proper working code I needed to read the datasheets.
I studied the KM41C4000D, KM41V4000D CMOS DRAM datasheet and other sources like

and
